- **Content-Based Filtering**: Analyzes product attributes for personalized recommendations.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved accuracy.
- **Scalable Design**: Handles large datasets and user interactions efficiently.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes precision, recall, and F1 score to measure effectiveness.

## Objectives
- Develop a recommendation engine using collaborative filtering.
- Enhance user experience by providing personalized product suggestions.
- Implement scalable and flexible architecture for handling large datasets.
- Evaluate model performance using industry-standard metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Recommendation Techniques**: Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid approaches
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, recall, F1 score

## System Architecture
The system comprises several key modules:

### 1. Data Collection
- Gathers user data, including purchase history, product views, and ratings.
- Collects product attributes and metadata.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Cleans and processes the data for analysis.
- Handles missing values and duplicates.

### 3. Feature Extraction
- Extracts meaningful features using techniques like PCA and latent factor analysis.

### 4. Model Development
- Implements collaborative filtering and hybrid recommendation models.
- Uses cosine similarity to identify relationships between users and products.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluates recommendation quality using precision, recall, and F1 score.

### 6. Deployment
- Integrates the recommendation engine into an e-commerce platform.
